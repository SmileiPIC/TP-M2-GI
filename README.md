# TP-M2-GI
Numerical practical for the students of the M2 - Grands Instruments.

# List of contents
- `Answers_Form` to complete the practical exercises.
- `Handouts`, to be built with LaTeX. To complete the practical, solve the exercises in this file.
- `Instructions_Cluster`, to be built with LaTex, with instructions to compile the code, run and postprocess simulations.
- `Postprocessing_Scripts`, in Python, to analyze the laser pulse propagation, the plasma wave generation and the electron bunch properties.
- `ScriptSetEnvironment`, a bash script to load the libraries and variable definitions to build Smilei on the cluster.
- `InputNamelist.py`, in Python, to run the simulations of the practical.
- `submission_script.sh`, a slurm job submission script to run Smilei simulations on the cluster.
