The simulations in this practical use many features in `Smilei <https://smileipic.github.io/Smilei/index.html>`_ that would not exist without the teamwork of the code developers, maintainers and collaborators, to whom we extend our gratitude.

We are grateful to all the students who attend this TP each year since 2019, contributing to the improvement of its material through their invaluable feedback.

The authors also wish to thank the engineers of the cluster Ruche in the Moulon Mesocentre and the engineers of the LLR HPC clusters for computer resources and help.
