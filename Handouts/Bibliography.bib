	abstract = {Plasma injection schemes are crucial for producing high-quality electron beams in laser–plasma accelerators. This article introduces the general concepts of plasma injection. First, a Hamiltonian model for particle trapping and acceleration in plasma waves is introduced; ionization injection and colliding-pulse injection are described in the framework of this Hamiltonian model. We then proceed to consider injection in plasma density gradients.},

@article{Terzani2019,
	Abstract = {In laser-driven, plasma wakefield acceleration regimes (LWFA), when relevant scale lengths of the laser envelope and of the driven plasma waves are well separated from the wavelength and frequency of the laser fast oscillating component, a reduced physical model (usually referred to as the envelope model), has been introduced, allowing to formulate the laser--plasma equations in terms of laser cycle-averaged dynamical variables. As a main consequence, physical regimes where this reduced model applies, can be investigated with significant savings of computational resources still assuring comparable accuracy, with respect to standard Particle-In-Cell (PIC) models where all relevant space--time scales have to be resolved. Here we propose a computational framework characterized by two previously unexplored numerical implementations of the envelope model. The first one is based on explicit second order leapfrog integration of the exact wave equation for laser pulse propagation in a laboratory coordinate system in 3D cartesian geometry, replacing the usually quoted representation in an Eulerian frame moving at the speed of light. Since the laser and driven wakefield wave equations in a laboratory frame are advection dominated, we introduce a proper modification of finite differences approximating longitudinal space derivatives, to minimize dispersive numerical errors coming from the discretized advection operators. The proposed implementation, avoiding semi-implicit procedures otherwise required when dealing with a comoving frame, assures significant saving in computational time and ease of implementation for parallel platforms. The associated equation of motion for plasma particles has been integrated, as in standard PIC codes, using the Boris pusher, properly extended to take into account the specific form of the Lorentz force in the envelope model. As a second contribution, a novel numerical implementation of the plasma dynamics equations in the cold-fluid approximation, is presented. The scheme is based on the second-order one-step Adams--Bashforth time integrator coupled to upwind non-oscillatory WENO reconstruction for discretized space derivatives. The proposed integration scheme for the Eulerian fluid equations is equivalent to a leapfrog scheme with an added higher order dissipative truncation errors. It can be used either as a much faster, yet of comparable accuracy, alternative to the PIC representation of plasma particle motion, or even in a hybrid fluid--particle combination when kinetic effects and particle injection and acceleration in a wakefield have to be investigated.},

	Abstract = {Three dimensional particle in cell simulations of laser wakefield acceleration require a considerable amount of resources but are necessary to have realistic predictions and to design future experiments. The planned experiments for the Apollon laser also include two stages of plasma acceleration, for a total plasma length of the order of tens of millimeters or centimeters. In this context, where traditional 3D numerical simulations would be computationally very expensive, we present the results of the application of a recently proposed envelope method, to describe the laser pulse and its interaction with the plasma without the need to resolve its high frequency oscillations. The implementation of this model in the code Smilei is described, as well as the results of benchmark simulations against standard laser simulations and applications for the design of two stage Apollon experiments.},

	abstract = {The resolution of the system given by Maxwell’s equations and Vlasov equation in three dimensions can describe all the phenomena of interest for laser wakefield acceleration, with few exceptions (e.g. ionization). Such arduous task can be numerically completed using Particle in Cell (PIC) codes, where the plasma is sampled by an ensemble of macroparticles and the electromagnetic fields are defined on a computational grid. However, the resulting three dimensional PIC simulations require substantial resources and often yield a larger amount of information than the one necessary to study a particular aspect of a phenomenon. Reduced models, i.e. models of the Maxwell-Vlasov system taking into account approximations and symmetries, are thus of fundamental importance for preliminary studies and parametric scans. In this work, the implementation of one of these models in the code SMILEI, an envelope description of the laser-plasma interaction with cylindrical symmetry, is described.}

	Abstract = {Plasmas are an attractive medium for the next generation of particle accelerators because they can support electric fields greater than several hundred gigavolts per meter. These accelerating fields are generated by relativistic plasma waves{\textemdash}space-charge oscillations{\textemdash}that can be excited when a high-intensity laser propagates through a plasma. Large currents of background electrons can then be trapped and subsequently accelerated by these relativistic waves. In the forced laser wake field regime, where the laser pulse length is of the order of the plasma wavelength, we show that a gain in maximum electron energy of up to 200 megaelectronvolts can be achieved, along with an improvement in the quality of the ultrashort electron beam.},
